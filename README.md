RootBytes is a project inspired by the "Monolith First" pattern, emphasizing simplicity and maintainability in software architecture. The project is designed to evolve into microservices as it grows and requirements change.

## About Monolith First

> "Almost all successful microservice stories started with a monolith that got too big and was broken up."  
> — Martin Fowler

This philosophy encourages starting with a monolithic architecture before considering microservices, ensuring a solid foundation and easier scaling.
